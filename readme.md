# VIROMEdash - Global Virome Sequence Metadata Visualizer

## 📌 What is VIROMEdash?

**VIROMEdash** is a visual analytics tool for exploring global viral sequence metadata from the [NCBI Virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/) database. It provides interactive dashboards that visualize metadata across five major dimensions:

- Taxonomy (species)
- Host organism
- Geography
- Collection date
- Baltimore classification

The portal includes data mined from NCBI Virus (as of May 2022), and also supports uploading custom datasets or accession lists.
